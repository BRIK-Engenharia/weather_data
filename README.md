# Weather Script

## State of the script:
The script is still in development. Unfortunately, changes by the MERRA-2 archive set the state of the script from a working version to a testing version. 

## How to use the script:
1. Register an account at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/
2. Go to my applications and add NASA GESDISC DATA ARCHIVE
3. Input your username and password when requested by the script

##**Important: The script will exit with an error in its current state!!!**
